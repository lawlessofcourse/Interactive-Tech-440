LIBRARIES NEEDED: Geometrize, Sound.

In setup check the sound inputs, there are multiple ways to get sound to this sketch.
I personally like using the AudioIn and use a external application to route your audio 
internally so that Processing can listen to any sound playing through your computer.

I have it set up with a sound file that seems quite fitting. You're welcome to keep this sketch, put your name in, and play with it. 
This intially was a testing sketch where I wanted to play around with the Geometrize library, text and fonts. 
I'm really happy how this turned out and is an example of the work I've been doing over the past semesters in Processing.

This sketch is ugly! like I said it was intially for testing but I really liked how it turned out. 
Usually for my Particle class I'll create a secondary class called Particle System that controls the arrayList of the particles, 
Also a good amount of global variables I have can be made into local ones. Definately needs cleaning - might run faster that way too.

Thanks for a fun class and semester! - Jack
