# Milestone 2

Project Idea remains the same. I still plan on building a 2D or 2.5D shooter in which the player must eliminate enemies and avoid traps in order to progress through the level. I would like to include upgrades for the characters and more challenging enemies as they progress. I plan with starting out with easy enemies who have to melee hit you to do damage then further on enemies will be able to shoot. Design does not matter much but I would like to do some asset design; so I know how it's done and to have a more unique game.
