# Milestone 1

For my Final Project idea I would like to start with building a simple platformer shooter. It would be either a 2D or a 2.5D game with most the assets acquired from resources such as the Unity asset store. The player would have to overcome obstacles in the way and reach the end of a level to progress further.
