# Game Engines Project

## Project Idea:
2.5 D Side Scroller using abstract art Nic and I have developed over the years.
Simple space shooter type game but you move from left to right, possible for other levels to facing different directions. Shooter: you have to fight off waves of abstract enemies that can hurt you. Goal is to survive. After certain number of waves you get upgrades/change shape and bullet shape/type. Enemies will become more difficult as the waves progress. 

Design: I plan on using a combination of softwares to develop animations and characters for the game. I have a plugin for After Effects called the Trapcode Suite. In the suite is a particle system that is really easy to design and render out. This has audio reactive options that I might explore. But this will be used for explosions, bullets, fog, and other abstract designs that will upgrade the character. I have a few ideas for designs/upgrades - Fire upgrade, Plasma upgrade, water upgrade, etc. These are looks I can create using this plugin.

-Build Upon Idea: The player has gravity with a ceiling and ground. When player jumps(hits spacebar) they invert their gravity and make the ceil the floor: player must jump from ceiling to floor and shoot during to eliminate enemy players. This should be an easy concept to apply to the project as the project will already be set up with a floor and ceiling. Call this idea the JUMPER.

If possible I would like to explore audio reaction within game. Such as an overplaying song effecting in game elements and/or the sound of explosions in the game trigger audio reactive effects.


## Backstory:
I was originally planning on creating a 2.5D platformer with the same kind of abstract approach, but Nic presented this idea for me and I felt that this is a good place to start and build a base for more intricate games.

Most inspiration for this has been from my numerous animation/graphic design classes and coding classes. I wanted to use assets and tools I've already collected. Some of those tools include plugins for After Effects, assets I've created in maya and cinema 4d. I would like to be a way to show some of my other work.

## Timeline:
Currently I'm working on a the Game Controller, Player Movement, and Shooting. Along with the coding we are currently working on collecting/creating 3D/2D assets to include in the game. I plan on using some assets I've already made in 3D animation class.

Plan on creating assets as we go but the code/engine for the game is most important.

After intial code/game is ready - create upgrades/design looks in After Effects using the Trapcode Suite. - main issue will be getting the designs to loop - the particle system is dynamic so it is ever evolving but there are features so you can set it in a loop. 

## Functional  
* ENEMY AI: Enemies Come in waves moving in x direction, randomly moving in Y direction, and shooting in a straight line ahead where the player will be.
* Player movement and shooting: Player can move across screen on the Y axis and limited direction in the X. Player cannot aim with Mouse or WASD: Their rotation is locked so they have to move across the sceen on the Y axis to aim.
* Wave Progression
  * Enemy Waves and Evolution: enemies will come in greater numbers and be stronger as you progress through waves.
  * Player Progression: Player will change Sprite and become more powerful(damage)

* Menu: Start, High Score: keep track of wave progression and enemies killed.
* Game Over/Player Lives: Player gets 3 Lives.

## Non-Functional Requirement
* Abstract evolving/changing background  
* JUMPER idea
* Collectables - Earn extra/double xp for limited time. Collect parts for an ultimate upgrade.
* Audio reaction. I'm not sure the capabilites of using audio reaction in the game but would be a cool idea to experiment with given the time. 

## Story
* Currently don't have a story line for this game. It's basically and experimentation of abstract objects and their interaction.

## Current Progress
* We have a base side scrolling shooter. We need to develop enemy AI(in progress), Wave Progression, and Player Dynamics(in progress)
* Plan to complete this project at the end of this semester but can see more assets being added easily in the future.
