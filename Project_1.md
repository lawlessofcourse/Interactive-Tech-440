## PROJECT 1 IDEAS

What do I want? - work on supercollider/Processing system, make it more interactive for the performer, evolving shapes overtime. Certain sounds make certain visuals, design supercollider section for guitar, design section for voice, etc. Is this interactive or reactive? Maybe guitarist has pedal and when pedal hits it changes the visual design as well as the guitar distortion. - For a DJ set Link midi controller buttons to que visuals and distortions.

**Input:**
Human -> Instrument -> Amp and/or Microphone -> SuperCollider
SuperCollider Processes sound and sends OSC messages

(I could even use supercollider as the instrument and have messages send to specific sounds, linked to specific visuals, with trip wires to change based on an input change. There would be more control, especially if linked with a midi controller.)

**Decision Making:**
Processing recieves OSC messages from SuperCollider and decides what to do with that data// distorts visuals

**Output:**
Processing displays visuals on screen.

It would be cool to do a dance to music with on screen visuals or even project the dancers on screen as animatoins with either motion tracking or sensors, tell a visual story to the music playing through dance and visuals, performers have contoller on them to change the visuals as they perform/ certain body movements que visuals and distortions.


Another idea is to use resolume, make a set of visuals linked with sounds and live mix the performance, with pedals for distortion. Resolume allows you to create clips and mix those clips, the clips can either have just audio, just video or both. The idea is to design visuals and audio that work and look nice together. Make about 20 of these and its up to the performer on how to present the material, they can tell a story visually or audiotorially, making a very dynamic performance that can be different every time.
